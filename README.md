# Secret Marriage Proposal Button

This is a fun web project where you prank someone with a "Will you marry me?" question. 

### Features:

- Once "Yes" is clicked, it shows the actual **"Will you marry me?"** question.
- If "Yes" is clicked again, a secret message appears.
- If "No" is clicked, the button moves around the screen, making it harder to click.

### How to Use:
1. Upload the **index.html** to a web server or host it online.

Enjoy the fun!
